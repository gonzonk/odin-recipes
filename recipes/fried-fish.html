            <li>8 (4 ounce) fillets cod</li>

            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Rinse cod fillets, pat dry, and season with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li>Mix flour, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; add egg and stir well to combine. Gradually mix in enough beer to make a thin batter.</li>

            <li>Fry several fillets at a time, turning once, until cooked through and golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.</li>

            <li>Drain on paper towels. Repeat to cook remaining fillets. Serve warm.</li>
